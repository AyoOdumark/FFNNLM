This is an implementation of A Neural Probabilistic Language Model paper. 

The Neural Probabilistic Language Model explains the feedforward neural network Language Model. Bengio introduces the idea of the word embeddings being a part of the overall network architecture

This is an old paper but sets the tone for language modelling down the line. It showed that neural network can infact model a probability distribution on words.
